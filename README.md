# Code for FBR: Dynamic Memory-Aware Fast Rerouting

This is code for the paper *FBR: Dynamic Memory-Aware Fast Rerouting*. This repository is based on a version of MPLS-Kit, which is available at https://github.com/juartinv/mplskit.


# Reproduce results
TODO: Fix venv stuff?? Scripts use a venv, but where does it come from?

TODO: Setup script to run all steps

1. Download topology files from [TODO: INSERT LINK], and place them into a folder called `topologies`.
2. Create the experiment configurations, run
```./scripts/create_confs.sh no```. However, this will take a long time. To only create a subset of the problems, filter to only those topologies starting with `zoo_A` by
`./scripts/create_confs.sh no zoo_A`.
3. To run a specific configuration on the first `n` problems, run `./scripts/run-problem-subset.sh CONF_NAME n`, where `CONF_NAME` is the name of the configuration, i.e. name of the file in the configurations folder, e.g. `./confs/zoo_Aarnet/conf_rsvp-fn.yml` is the configuration `rsvp-fn`.

TODO: Script to run all confs
4. When all the desired configurations have been run, the latex plots can be generated by running `python3 latex_generation_all.py`, which outputs all the .tex files to the `latex` folder
